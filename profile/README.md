# The Valency Project

The Valency Project aims to fix the problems with existing Decentralised Networks and Cryptocurrency Exchanges. The project consists of a Decentralised Network and an Open-Source Decentralised Asset Exchange built on top of the network using smart contracts to execute most of the key exchange functions such as buying, selling, shorting and lending.<br><br>

## Core Repositories
**The main code is split up into 3 repositories: valency-core, valency-network, and valency-exchange:**<br>
### **valency-core**
Contains the core functions for both the network and exchange. Each function is designed to be modular for use in other cool, open-source projects.
The valency-core repository is made up of the following modular components:
1. **Networking Framework**
2. **Onion Routing**
3. **AES Symmetric Encryption**
4. **NTRUencrypt Asymmetric Encryption**
5. **Random Algorithm**
6. **Console UI Framework**
7. **File Reader and Writer**
8. **Quicksort**
9. **SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm**
10. **LZMA Compression Algorithm**
11. **Traceable Ring Signatures**
12. **GUI Framework**
13. **Custom Types**
### **valency-network**
Contains the code dedicated to the Valency Network. It mainly utilises valency-core for key functionality.
The valency-network repository is split up into the following key components:
1. **Valency Node:** The program that the nodes on the Valency Network run to keep the network functioning.
2. **Valency Wallet:** Similar to the Bitcoin Core wallet - send and receive using this wallet. It is cross-platform with a GUI.
3. **Valency Lite Wallet:** Contains most of the functionality of the full wallet, however utilises a console-based UI.
4. **Valency Developer Tools:** Contains documentation, and tools for uploading smart contracts to the network.
### **valency-exchange**
Contains the code dedicated to the Valency Exchange. This utilises valency-core for key functions.<br>
The valency-exchange repository is split up into the following key components:
1. **Smart Contracts:** The smart-contracts that fullfill transactions and perform auxilary tasks on the Valency Exchange.
2. **Various Backend Systems:** The backend systems responsible for communicating with the smart-contracts and fulfilling transactions.
3. **System Diagrams:** To allow customers to view a simplified version of how the open-source software processes transactions.

## Auxilary Repositories
### **Website Source-Code**
The Valency Network and Valency Exchange website source-code is stored under valency-exchange-website and valency-network-website accordingly. The code for the project website is stored in valency-website.
### **valency-whitepaper**
The valency-whitepaper repository contains all the resources used to create the whitepaper.<br>
