# The Valency Project

The Valency Project aims to fix the problems with existing Decentralised Networks and Cryptocurrency Exchanges. The project consists of a Decentralised Network and an Open-Source Decentralised Asset Exchange built on top of the network using smart contracts to execute most of the key exchange functions such as buying, selling, shorting and lending.

**The main code is split up into 3 repositories: valency-core, valency-network, and valency-exchange:**
<br>**valency-core:** Contains the core functions for both the network and exchange. Each function is designed to be modular for use in other cool, open-source projects.
<br>**valency-network:** Contains the code dedicated for the Valency Network. This utilises valency-core for key functions.
<br>**valency-exchange:** Contains the code dedicated for the Valency Exchange. This utilises valency-core for key functions.
